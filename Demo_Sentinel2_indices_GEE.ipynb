    "The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) was developed by Gao et al. in the 1990is and is used to estimate the vegetation water content or moisture$^{[6]}$ and is widely used for drought monitoring. The index used the different absorption features of water in leaves in the NIR and SWIR part of the spectrum$^{[7]}$.\n",
    "It is calculated using bands in the NIR (B08) and SWIR (B11) region of the spectrum $^{[8]}$:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "NDMI values below 0 can indicate water stress (if vegetation is present), values above 0.4 indicate no water stress in the vegetation$^{[9]}$. The highest NDMI values in our image can be found in the forest where we have a lot of vegetation to store water in the canopy. The lake surface has a value of -1 indicating a non-vegetation surface. This is a bit counter-intuitive as we would expect a moisture or water index to be high over a large water body. To detect open water bodies we need to use a different water index.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: NDWI index is often used synonymously with the NDMI index, often using NIR-SWIR combination as one of the two options. Gao$^{[6]}$ also called the index NDWI. NDMI seems to be consistently described using NIR-SWIR combination. As the indices with these two combinations work very differently, with NIR-SWIR highlighting differences in water content of leaves, and GREEN-NIR highlighting differences in water content of water bodies, we have decided to separate the indices on our repository as NDMI using NIR-SWIR, and NDWI using GREEN-NIR$^{[8]}$ (quote from Sentinel-Hub)."
